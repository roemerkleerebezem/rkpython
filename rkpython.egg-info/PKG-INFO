Description: # rkpython
        
        ## Description
        This is a general use Python module.
        For now, it only contains some functions to make reading and **writing to text files** easier, as well as a function that returns the current **largest objects in memory**.
          
        ## Installation
        Use  
        ```
        pip install rkpython
        ```
          
        Then import it in Python with 
        ```python
        import rkpython as rk
        ```
        ## Functions
          
        ### to_txt()
        	
        	rk.to_txt(l=None, path='text_file.txt', overwrite=False, verbose = False)	
        	
        	--------------  
        
        	Saves a list to a .txt file.  
        	  
        	l : list, default is None  
        		List object to be saved.  
        	  
        	path : str, default is 'text_file.txt'  
        		File path (with file name) you want to save to.    
        	  
        	overwrite : bool, default is False    
        		Overwrites the file if it exists.  
        		  
        	verbose : boolean, default is False  
        		Prints out a message if the operation was succesful  
        		  
        	--------------  
        
        	Examples :  
        	  
        	rk.to_txt(var_list, './documents/vars.txt', verbose = True)  
        	>> File successfully written to ./documents/vars.txt 
        	
        ### read_txt()  
        
        	rk.read_txt(path='text_file.txt', verbose = False)    
        
        	--------------  
        
        	Reads from a text file, saving the result as a list, where each line is one item.  
        	  
        
        	path : str, default = 'text_file.txt'  
        		File path (with file name) you want to read from. Can be any type of file (.txt, .csv...)    
        	  
        	verbose : boolean, default is False  
        		Prints out a message if the operation was succesful  
        		  
        	--------------  
          
        	Examples :  
        	  
        	var_list = rk.read_txt('./documents/vars.txt', verbose = True)  
        	>> File successfully read from ./documents/vars.txt  
        	
        ### to_size()
        
        def to_size(size_in_bytes):
        
            Converts a number of bytes into a more readable unit, up until Terabytes, and rounds the number down to 1 decimal. Returns a string.
            
            --------------
                
            size_in_bytes : int
                Size in bytes that needs to be converted
                
            --------------
        
            Examples :
            
            get_size(124480000)
            >> '124.5 Mb'
        
        ### rk.get_mem()
        
        def get_mem(nb_objects = 10):
        
            Prints out a list of the largest objects stored in memory, as well as the total memory usage of global variables. Returns a string.
            
            --------------
                
            nb_objects : int, default =  10
                Maximum number of items to be printed out.
                
            --------------
        
            Examples :
            
            get_mem(5)
            >> Total usage : 25.3 Gb
            >>
            >>  5 largest objects :
            >>  _477  :  1.7 Gb
            >>  _529  :  1.7 Gb
            >>  _437  :  1.4 Gb
            >>  _412  :  1.3 Gb
            >>  _415  :  1.3 Gb
